# Task 4: E-commerce Event Analysis with LLM Integration

## 1. Event Analysis Overview

We analyzed a dataset containing 9,800 e-commerce events that track user behavior across the shopping journey. Here's the distribution of events:

### Raw Event Distribution
| Event Type          | Count | Percentage |
|---------------------|-------|------------|
| view_item          | 3,043 | 31.05% |
| view_item_list     | 2,514 | 25.65% |
| add_to_cart        | 1,579 | 16.11% |
| view_cart          | 762  | 7.78%  |
| remove_from_cart   | 515  | 5.26%  |
| add_to_wishlist    | 489  | 4.99%  |
| begin_checkout     | 360  | 3.67%  |
| add_payment_info   | 279  | 2.85%  |
| add_shipping_info  | 266  | 2.71%  |
| purchase           | 193  | 1.97%  |

## 2. Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Gemini API for advanced analysis
- Pandas for data manipulation

### Key Components
- EcommerceAnalyzer class for data processing
- Database connectivity
- Event categorization system
- Gemini API integration
- Results storage in JSON format

## 3. LLM-Based Categorization

Using the Gemini API, we categorized events into behavioral segments and analyzed patterns:

### Customer Segments Identified

1. **Browsers (60%)**
   - Primary events: `view_item` (3,043), `view_item_list` (2,514)
   - High view-item rate
   - Low add-to-cart conversion
   - Primarily browsing behavior

2. **Cart Abandoners (20%)**
   - Primary events: `add_to_cart` (1,579), `remove_from_cart` (515)
   - Drop-off before `begin_checkout` (360)
   - High cart abandonment rate (87.77%)
   - Significant revenue opportunity

3. **Completers (10%)**
   - Event sequence: `begin_checkout` → `add_payment_info` → `add_shipping_info` → `purchase`
   - Complete purchase journey (193 purchases)
   - Core revenue generators
   - Full funnel conversion

4. **View Cart Users (8%)**
   - Primary event: `view_cart` (762)
   - Multiple cart views without proceeding to `begin_checkout`
   - Hesitant behavior
   - Price-sensitive group

5. **Wishlist Users (5%)**
   - Primary event: `add_to_wishlist` (489)
   - Low `purchase` conversion rate
   - High wishlist-to-cart ratio
   - Potential for targeted marketing

## 4. Key Metrics & Insights

### Funnel Analysis
1. Product Views: 3,043 (100%)
2. Cart Additions: 1,579 (51.89%)
3. Cart Views: 762 (48.26%)
4. Checkout Started: 360 (47.24%)
5. Purchase Complete: 193 (6.34% overall conversion)

### Critical Patterns
- Cart Abandonment Rate: 87.77%
- Checkout Abandonment: 46.39%
- View-to-Cart Conversion: 51.89%
- Wishlist Usage: 16.07%
- Cart Removal Rate: 32.62%

## 5. Generated Insights

The LLM analysis provided actionable insights for improvement:

### High-Priority Recommendations
1. Optimize checkout process (Expected lift: 15-20%)
2. Implement cart abandonment emails (Expected lift: 10-15%)
3. Improve product information display (Expected lift: 5-10%)
4. Enhance website UX/UI (Expected lift: 8-12%)
5. Target wishlist users with promotions (Expected lift: 3-5%)

### Bottleneck Analysis
1. Add to Cart → Checkout (77.2% drop)
2. Checkout → Purchase (46.4% drop)
3. View Item → Add to Cart (48.1% drop)

## 6. Results Storage

All analysis results are stored in JSON format with timestamp-based naming:
- Event distribution data
- Funnel analysis metrics
- Pattern identification
- Derived events
- LLM analysis results

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully leveraged LLM technology to provide deeper insights into e-commerce behavior patterns. The combination of traditional analytics with AI-driven analysis offers actionable recommendations for improving conversion rates and user experience.
