## 1. Event Data Overview

### Raw Event Distribution
| Event Type          | Count | Percentage |
|---------------------|-------|------------|
| view_item          | 3,043 | 31.05% |
| view_item_list     | 2,514 | 25.65% |
| add_to_cart        | 1,579 | 16.11% |
| view_cart          | 762  | 7.78%  |
| remove_from_cart   | 515  | 5.26%  |
| add_to_wishlist    | 489  | 4.99%  |
| begin_checkout     | 360  | 3.67%  |
| add_payment_info   | 279  | 2.85%  |
| add_shipping_info  | 266  | 2.71%  |
| purchase           | 193  | 1.97%  |

Total events analyzed: 9,800

Note: Event types sourced from GA4 E-commerce event specifications.

## 2. Implementation Overview

This project implements an e-commerce event analysis system that connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch and analyze user behavior events. The system categorizes events into meaningful behavioral groups and provides detailed analytics.

### Technologies Used
- Python for data processing
- PostgreSQL for data storage
- Pandas for data manipulation
- JSON for results storage

### Integration with AI Services
The system experimented with Hugging Face's API for event categorization to explore AI-powered classification. While the integration provided interesting insights, a rule-based approach proved more reliable for our specific e-commerce event types.

## 3. Core Components

### Database Integration
- PostgreSQL connection handling
- Event data retrieval using SQL aggregation
- Error handling and connection management

### Event Categorization System
The system categorizes events into four main behavioral groups:

1. **Browsing Events**
   - Keywords: 'view', 'browse', 'search'
   - Captures product discovery behavior
   - Examples: view_item, view_item_list, view_cart

2. **Consideration Events**
   - Keywords: 'cart', 'wishlist'
   - Tracks shopping cart interactions
   - Examples: add_to_cart, remove_from_cart, add_to_wishlist

3. **Conversion Events**
   - Keywords: 'purchase', 'checkout', 'payment'
   - Monitors purchase completion
   - Examples: begin_checkout, add_payment_info, purchase

4. **Retention Events**
   - Keywords: 'return', 'review'
   - Tracks post-purchase engagement
   - Examples: product reviews, return requests

## 4. Analysis Results

Based on our latest analysis (timestamp: 2025-05-31 19:21:30), the system identified the following distribution:

### Event Distribution
- Total Events Analyzed: 10
- Category Breakdown:
  - Browsing: 40% (4 events)
  - Consideration: 30% (3 events)
  - Conversion: 30% (3 events)
  - Retention: 0% (0 events)

### Detailed Event Categorization

1. **Browsing Category (40%)**
   - view_item
   - view_item_list
   - view_cart
   - add_shipping_info

2. **Consideration Category (30%)**
   - add_to_cart
   - remove_from_cart
   - add_to_wishlist

3. **Conversion Category (30%)**
   - begin_checkout
   - add_payment_info
   - purchase

## 5. Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
```sql
SELECT 
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM events 
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

### Analysis Storage
Results are stored in JSON format containing:
- Analysis timestamp
- Event summaries
- Category distribution
- Detailed insights per category

## 6. Key Insights

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Highest event concentration (40%)
   - Multiple viewing events before cart addition
   - Important for initial user engagement

2. **Shopping Intent**
   - Equal distribution between consideration and conversion (30% each)
   - Clear progression from cart addition to purchase
   - Balanced conversion funnel

3. **Purchase Behavior**
   - Strong presence of payment and checkout events
   - Complete purchase journey tracking
   - Clear conversion path identification

## 7. System Benefits

1. **Real-time Analysis**
   - Direct database connectivity
   - Immediate event processing
   - Up-to-date insights

2. **Scalable Architecture**
   - SQL-based aggregation
   - Efficient data handling
   - Robust error management

3. **Actionable Insights**
   - Clear event categorization
   - Percentage-based analysis
   - JSON-formatted results

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully provides a clear picture of user behavior patterns in the e-commerce platform. The system's ability to categorize and analyze events offers valuable insights for understanding user journey and improving conversion rates.

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced pattern recognition
2. Time-based analysis
3. User segment identification
4. Custom event categorization rules
